    <strong>Description:</strong>
    <span property="description">The library catalog as a catalog of works
      was an infectious idea, which together with research led to
      reconceptualization in the form of the FRBR conceptual model. Two
      categories of lacunae emergeâ€”the expression entity, and gaps in the
      model such as aggregates and dynamic documents. Evidence needed to
      extend the FRBR model is available in contemporary research on
      instantiation. The challenge for the bibliographic community is to
      begin to think of FRBR as a form of knowledge organization system,
      adding a final dimension to classification. The articles in the present
      special issue offer a compendium of the promise of the FRBR
      model.</span>
