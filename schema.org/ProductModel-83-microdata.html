A ProductModel gives a datasheet or vendor specification of a
product (in the sense of a prototypical description).  Use this type
when you are describing a product datasheet rather than an actual
product, e.g. if you are the manufacturer of the product and want to
mark up your product specification pages. For example: The ACME
Colorvision 123 specifiation on the ACME Corp. site for that model.

 <span itemprop="name">ACME Colorvision 123</span>
 <span itemprop="description">The ACME Colorvision 123 is
  the leading-edge color TV from our company.</span>
 EAN/UPC: <span itemprop="gtin13">1234567890123</span>

Recommendation: Try to provide identifiers (gtin13, gtin14, gtin8, mpn
properties) and link to you as the manufacturer (manufacturer
property) so that search engines can use your data to enrich offers of
your products found elsewhere.
