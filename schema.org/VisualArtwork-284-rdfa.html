                <cite>Still Life under the Lamp</cite>, from 1962, made when the artist 
                was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works 
                in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early 
                1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which 
                Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the 
                image into its final form.
