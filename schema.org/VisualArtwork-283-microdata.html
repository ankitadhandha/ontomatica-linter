                <cite>My Bed</cite> was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in 
                <time datetime="1998">1999</time> as one 
                of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her 
                bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media 
                attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has 
                persisted.

            The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the 
            fact that the <span itemprop="artMedium">bedsheets</span> were stained 
            with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room 
            (such as <span itemprop="artMedium">condoms</span>, 
            <span itemprop="artMedium">a pair of knickers</span> with menstrual 
            period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, 
            including a <span itemprop="artMedium">pair of slippers</span>). The 
            <span itemprop="artMedium">bed</span> was presented in the state that 
            Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for 
            several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship 
            difficulties.
