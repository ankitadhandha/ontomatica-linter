      <p itemprop="description">For most people, the primary reason to purchase life insurance is to help provide for dependents in the case of your death and the resulting loss of income. To determine a coverage amount, estimate what your family members would need after youâ€™re gone to meet immediate, ongoing, and future financial obligations including funeral, rent or mortgage, other every day bills, college, and retirement.</p>
